            <p>Don’t be fooled by a peach’s small size and delicate skin. Just one medium peach has up to 13.2% of the
                vitamin C you need each day. This nutrient helps your body heal wounds and keeps your immune system
                going strong. It also helps get rid of “free radicals” -- chemicals that have been linked to cancer
                because they can damage your cells.</p>
